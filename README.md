# 👋 Welcome to sgomc’s Repository

Hello! I’m **Maccollins Obijiaku**, a first‑year Computer Science student at Trinity College Dublin, based in Cavan, Ireland. I’m passionate about applying data analysis, algorithms, and software development to build practical solutions. Below you’ll find a showcase of my key projects, technologies I use, and how to get in touch.

## 🗂️ Project Portfolio

### 1. Gym Occupancy Predictor (gym-goer)

**Tech:** Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib

A data‑driven application that analyzes historical gym attendance data to recommend the best times to work out. Key features:

* **Data Ingestion:** Processes CSV logs of crowd counts by timestamp.
* **Peak/Off‑Peak Analysis:** Uses pandas to compute daily and weekly occupancy trends.
* **Curve Fitting:** Applies simple regression to predict traffic patterns for gyms with limited data.
* **Visualization:** Generates interactive plots showing optimal visit windows.
* **Outcome:** Achieved a H1 in my Leaving Cert project; now available as an open‑source prototype.

### 2. Personal Website (maths‑in‑ohio)

**Tech:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Altervista hosting

A responsive educational platform designed to make basic arithmetic engaging for students:

* **Custom Design:** Tailored layout and styling for clear readability.
* **Interactive Exercises:** JavaScript‑powered quizzes for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
* **Deployment:** Hosted on Altervista with FTP workflow and automated updates.

### 3. Collaborative Coding Project (programming‑project‑group‑10)

**Tech:** Java, GitHub, Agile workflow

A team‑based software development exercise in which we:

* **Designed** a modular Java application (e.g., a tournament scheduler).
* **Managed** version control and pull requests using GitHub.
* **Practiced** agile ceremonies with regular stand‑ups and retrospectives.


## 🛠️ Technical Skills & Tools

* **Languages:** Java, Python, JavaScript, Bash (basic)
* **Data:** pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, Excel (pivot tables, macros)
* **Web:** HTML5, CSS3, responsive design, Altervista deployment
* **Algorithms & DS:** Strong problem‑solving (44+ LeetCode Qs), sorting, search, dynamic programming
* **Version Control:** Git, GitHub workflows (branching, PRs)
* **Collaboration:** Microsoft Teams, Slack, Zoom, Notion
* **Systems:** Windows, Linux (Ubuntu), shell scripting fundamentals
