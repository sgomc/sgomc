# 👋 Welcome to sgomc’s Repository

Hello! I’m **Maccollins Obijiaku**, a first‑year Computer Science student at Trinity College Dublin, based in Cavan, Ireland. I’m passionate about applying data analysis, algorithms, and software development to build practical solutions. Below you’ll find a showcase of my key projects, technologies I use, and how to get in touch.

## 🗂️ Project Portfolio

### 1. Gym Occupancy Predictor (gym-goer)

**Tech:** Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib

A data‑driven application that analyzes historical gym attendance data to recommend the best times to work out. Key features:

* **Data Ingestion:** Processes CSV logs of crowd counts by timestamp.
* **Peak/Off‑Peak Analysis:** Uses pandas to compute daily and weekly occupancy trends.
* **Curve Fitting:** Applies simple regression to predict traffic patterns for gyms with limited data.
* **Visualization:** Generates interactive plots showing optimal visit windows.
* **Outcome:** Achieved a H1 in my Leaving Cert project; now available as an open‑source prototype.

### 2. Educational (Hackaton) Website (maths‑in‑ohio)

**Tech:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Altervista hosting

A responsive educational platform designed to make basic arithmetic engaging for students:

* **Custom Design:** Tailored layout and styling for clear readability.
* **Interactive Exercises:** JavaScript‑powered quizzes for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
* **Deployment:** Locally.

### 3. Collaborative Coding Project (programming‑project‑group‑10)

**Tech:** Java, GitHub, Agile workflow

A team‑based software development exercise in which we:

* **Designed** a modular Java application (e.g., a tournament scheduler).
* **Managed** version control and pull requests using GitHub.
* **Practiced** agile ceremonies with regular stand‑ups and retrospectives.
### 4. 🌐 Arcane: Front-End Showcase with Elementor

**Overview:**
Arcane is a portfolio website built on WordPress using the Elementor page-builder plugin to demonstrate modern front-end design and deployment workflows. It highlights your ability to craft visually appealing, responsive sites and to manage a live hosting environment end-to-end.

#### 🔑 Core Features

* **Elementor-Powered Layouts**
  Clean, customizable sections built entirely with Elementor’s drag-and-drop interface, showing off skills in layout composition, typography, and responsive breakpoints.

* **Custom Theming & Styling**
  Additional CSS tweaks and Elementor theme overrides to tailor the site’s look beyond default templates—demonstrating mastery of both the tool and underlying HTML/CSS.

* **Live Hosting & Deployment**
  Hosted on Altervista; covers the full cycle of deploying WordPress, configuring DNS/FTP, and maintaining updates and backups in a production environment.

* **Showcase Sections**

  * **Hero Banner** with call-to-action
  * **Project Galleries** featuring screenshots and live links
  * **About & Contact** forms styled with Elementor widgets

---

#### 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

* **CMS & Builder:** WordPress, Elementor Pro
* **Markup & Styling:** HTML5, CSS3 (custom overrides)
* **Hosting:** Altervista (FTP upload, site backups)
* **Graphics:** Adobe XD → SVG exports, optimized via SVGOMG

#### 🎯 Purpose & Impact

Arcane isn’t just a demo site—it’s a **proof of competence** in:

1. **Rapid Prototyping:** Leveraging Elementor to spin up professional layouts in minutes.
2. **Design Consistency:** Applying global styles, typography settings, and color schemes across pages.
3. **Responsive Best Practices:** Ensuring pixel-perfect rendering on desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints.
4. **Live Environment Management:** Handling WordPress installations, plugin updates, and routine maintenance on a public host.
